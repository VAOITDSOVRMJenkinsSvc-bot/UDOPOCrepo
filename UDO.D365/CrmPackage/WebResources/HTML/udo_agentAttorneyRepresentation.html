	<h1>Enclosure One – Guidelines for Answering Inquiries on Agent and Attorney Representation</h1>
		<h2>When was the final rule on “accreditation of agents and attorneys; agent and attorney fees” issued, and when did it become effective?</h2>
			<ul>VA published its final rule on “accreditation of agents and attorneys; agent and attorney fees” in the Federal Register on May 22, 2008, at 73 <i>FR 29851-29880</i>.  The final rule was effective June 23, 2008.</ul>
			<ul>The provisions shifting the entry point for paid representation to the time after the filing of a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) became effective on June 20, 2007.  The provisions relating to accreditation, power of attorney, fee assessments, and filing and review of fee agreements were effective June 23, 2008, thirty days after publication of VA's final rule in the Federal Register.</ul>
		<h2>Power of Attorney</h2>
			<h3>When was the final rule on “accreditation of agents and attorneys; agent and attorney fees” issued, and when did it become effective?</h3>
				<ul>VA has two power of attorney  (POA) forms: one for agents and attorneys, VA Form 21-22a, Appointment of Individual as Claimant’s Representative, and the other for veterans service organizations, VA Form 21-22, Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant’s Representative.  Under the new regulations, a properly executed POA, signed by both the claimant and representative, is required to represent claimants before VA.  Attorneys may no longer submit declaration of representation on their letterhead.  A properly executed POA also authorizes VA to release confidential health information, protected under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 7332, to the representative.  These forms can be found at:</ul>
				<ul><a href="http://www.va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp ">www.va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp </a></ul>
			<h3>Do I need to hire an agent or attorney to represent me before VA?</h3>
				<ul>No.  You do not need to hire an agent or attorney to represent you before VA.  Specifically, VA has a duty to notify you of the information and evidence necessary to substantiate a claim and to assist you in obtaining such evidence.  Veterans Service Organization (VSO) representatives are also available to guide you through the claims process, without charge.  VSO representatives are well-versed in veterans benefits law and are well-equipped to successfully assist you through the claims process.</ul>
			<h3>May I terminate my agent’s or attorney’s representation?</h3>
				<ul>Yes.  You may terminate your agent’s or attorney’s representation at any time.  However, your agent or attorney may still be entitled to a fee.</ul>
			<h3>May I limit the scope of the agent’s or attorney’s representation?</h3>
				<ul>Yes.  You may limit the scope of your agent’s or attorney’s representation regarding a particular claim by describing the limitation on VA Form 21-22a.  For example, you may limit your agent’s or attorney’s representation to only your claim for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</ul>
			<h3>Is my attorney or agent allowed to call the regional office and speak with a VA employee? </h3>
				<ul>Yes.  Each regional office (RO) has an AAFC who is designated to serve as a liaison for attorney and agent matters.  Please refer your attorney or agent to the RO’s AAFC. </ul>
		<h2>Accreditation</h2>
			<h3>What is accreditation?</h3>
				<ul>Accreditation is the authority granted by VA to representatives, agents, and attorneys to assist claimants in claims for VA benefits before VA.</ul>
			<h3>Who can represent claimants before VA?</h3>
				<ul>With one exception, described in the next paragraph, only accredited agents and attorneys or recognized VSO representatives can represent claimants before VA.  Attorneys and agents must be accredited by VA’s Office of the General Counsel (OGC ) and file a properly executed POA before they can represent claimants.  VSOs must be recognized by OGC and file a properly executed POA.</ul>
			<h3>What is the exception to the question noted above?  When can an unaccredited individual represent a claimant before VA?</h3>
				<ul>Under 38 C.F.R. § 14.630, any person may be authorized to represent a claimant before VA on one claim.  A request submitted to the RO under this authority must include a statement signed by both the claimant and the would-be-representative that no compensation will be charged or paid for the services, and must also include a properly executed VA Form 21-22a, Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative.  This authorization is limited to representation on one particular claim.  All exceptions to this rule must be approved by OGC.</ul>
			<h3>Who is responsible for managing VA’s accreditation program?</h3>
				<ul>VA’s OGC is responsible for managing VA’s accreditation program.  OGC's authority to regulate representation is limited to proceedings before the Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA), including all VBA regional offices, and the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA).  VA has no authority to regulate representation of claimants before any court, including the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</ul>
			<h3>How can I find out if an individual is accredited?</h3>
				<ul>VA’s OGC, Professional Staff Group II, has posted an internet-based listing of accredited attorneys, agents, and VSO representatives.  This system is available for access by VA personnel and members of the public to verify accreditation status.  The listing may be accessed through the VA website at the address provided below:</ul>
				<ul><a href="http://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.html ">www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.html </a></ul>
			<h3>How does VA accredit an attorney?</h3>
				<ul>To become accredited, an attorney must apply to OGC for accreditation on a VA Form 21a, Application for Accreditation as a Claims Agent or Attorney.  Unless information to the contrary is provided to VA, bar membership in good standing establishes an attorney's character and fitness to represent claimants before VA.  To maintain their accreditation, attorneys must satisfy a qualifying continuing legal education (CLE) requirement (approved by any state bar association) on veterans benefits law and procedure during the first year of accreditation, and must satisfy follow up CLE requirements not later than three years after the initial accreditation and every two years thereafter.  This form can be found at:</ul>
				<ul><a href="http://www.va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp ">www.va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp </a></ul>
			<h3>Do attorneys have to take a written exam to become accredited?</h3>
				<ul>No.  Attorneys do not have to take a written exam to become accredited; however, agents do.</ul>
			<h3>What is a VA Form 21a?</h3>
				<ul>VA Form 21a,<i>Application for Accreditation as a Claims Agent or Attorney</i>, requests information on the following: military service and civilian employment history; admission to practice before any Federal or State agency; experience representing benefit claimants before any agency; references; criminal history; and mental health history.</ul>
			<h3>How does an agent become accredited by VA?</h3>
				<ul>A person desiring accreditation as an agent must submit a VA Form 21a to OGC and must also establish his or her good character and reputation.  In addition, he or she must take a written examination under the supervision of the VA Regional Counsel of jurisdiction and achieve a score of 75% or better.  To maintain their accreditation, agents must satisfy a qualifying CLE requirement on veterans benefits law and procedure during the first year of accreditation, and must satisfy follow up CLE requirements not later than three years after the initial accreditation and every two years thereafter.</ul>
			<h3>Does an agent need to take a written test?</h3>
				<ul>Yes.  An agent must take a written examination under the supervision of the VA Regional Counsel of jurisdiction and achieve a score of 75% or better.  If the applicant fails to achieve a score of 75%, he or she may take the exam again.  However, he or she may not sit for the exam more than twice in any six-month period.</ul>
			<h3>If an agent or attorney was providing representation on a claim first initiated prior to June 23, 2008 (the effective date of this regulation), does he or she need to seek accreditation under the new regulations to continue providing representation on the same claim?</h3>
				<ul>No.  If  an agent or attorney was providing representation on a claim first initiated prior to June 23, 2008 (the effective date of this regulation), he or she does not need to seek accreditation to continue providing representation on the same claim.  However, to represent the claimant on a new claim on or after June 23, 2008, the agent or attorney must fulfill the accreditation requirements.</ul>
			<h3>Can an agent’s or attorney’s accreditation be terminated or cancelled?</h3>
				<ul>Yes.  Accreditation can be cancelled when an agent or attorney no longer meets the qualification standards.  Accreditation can also be terminated when OGC finds, by clear and convincing evidence, a violation of or refusal to comply with laws administered by VA, the charging of excessive fees, or other unlawful or unethical practice.  An agent or attorney’s suspension or debarment is also grounds for cancellation of VA accreditation.</ul>
			<h3>What do I do if I think an agent or attorney is engaging in improper conduct?</h3>
				<ul>You should gather relevant facts and provide a written explanation of the alleged improper conduct.  The explanation should include a description of the event, the agent’s or attorney’s name, date on which the event took place, and contact information for the reporting party.  Contact OGC at (202) 461-7699 with this information as soon as possible.</ul>
		<h2>Fees</h2>
			<h3>When is an agent or attorney allowed to represent me on a fee basis? </h3>
				<ul>If an NOD was filed on or after June 20, 2007, with respect to an AOJ decision, apply the new law.  Under the new law, an accredited agent or attorney may charge fees for services after the RO has issued a decision on a claim or claims, including any claim to reopen (based upon new and material evidence) and claim for increase in rate of benefit, if the agent or attorney has first complied with the POA and fee agreement requirements.  Under the new regulation, there is no requirement that the attorney or agent be hired within a specified time frame.  However, with respect to a request for revision of a clear and unmistakable error claim, VA already had the opportunity to initially decide the claim; therefore, paid representation is not precluded if the claimant filed an NOD with respect to the original challenged decision, on or after June 20, 2007, and, the agent or attorney has already complied with the power of attorney and fee agreement requirements.</ul>
				<ul>If an NOD was filed on or before June 19, 2007, apply the old law.  Under the old law, agents and attorneys may charge fees for services if BVA has made a final decision on the issues involved and the claimant retained the agent or attorney not later than one year following the date of the BVA decision, or while the case was at court.</ul>
			<h3>Who can charge a fee?</h3>
				<ul>Only accredited agents and attorneys may charge fees.</ul>
			<h3>Is there a standard fee agreement?</h3>
				<ul>No.  VA does not have a standard fee agreement for representation before the Department.  Under the new regulations, all fee agreements: must be in writing; must be signed by both the claimant and the agent or attorney; must contain the name of any disinterested party; must contain the applicant’s VA file number; and must state the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits.  A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to pay the agent and attorney out of past-due benefits, or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded by VA, will be considered to be an agreement in which the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA. </ul>
			<h3>Is there more than one type of fee agreement?</h3>
				<ul>Yes.  Generally, there are two types of fee agreements.  If you sign a fee agreement that indicates you wish VA to pay attorney fees directly out of past-due benefits, VA will pay the agent’s or attorney’s fees out of any past-due benefits awarded to you.  If you sign a fee agreement that indicates otherwise, or is unclear whether VA is to pay past-due benefits directly to an attorney, you are responsible for paying the attorney’s fees.  Also, if a fee agreement specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded by VA it will be considered to be an agreement in which the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant. </ul>
			<h3>Where should the agent or attorney file their fee agreements?</h3>
				<ul>All fee agreements must be filed with the Office of the General Counsel (022D), 810 Vermont Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20420, within 30 days of execution.  This filing is for the purpose of OGC’s reasonableness review.  In addition, if an agent or attorney desires a direct payment out of past-due benefits, he or she must file a copy of the fee agreement with the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), (mostly likely the RO) within 30 days of execution.  This filing is for the purpose of the AOJ’s eligibility determination.</ul>
			<h3>What should I do if the fee agreement does not state whether or not VA is to pay fees directly out of past-due benefits?</h3>
				<ul>If the agreement does not clearly specify whether VA is to pay fees directly out of past-due benefits, then the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation directly from the claimant without assistance from VA.</ul>
			<h3>How do I pay my agent or attorney his or her fees?</h3>
				<ul>If you sign a fee agreement that indicates you wish VA to pay attorney fees directly out of past-due benefits, then VA will pay the agent’s or attorney’s fees out of any past-due benefits awarded to you.  If you sign a fee agreement that indicates otherwise, or is unclear whether VA is to pay past-due benefits directly to an attorney, then you are responsible for paying the attorney’s fees. </ul>
			<h3>What is the maximum fee that an agent or attorney is allowed to charge me? </h3>
				<ul>If it is a direct pay fee agreement, then the fee must be limited to 20 percent, excluding expenses, of the total amount of any past-due benefit awarded on the basis of a claim.  This limit does not apply to cases where fees are not paid directly to the agent or attorney by VA.  However, in all cases, the agent’s or attorney’s fees must be reasonable.  Fees may be based on a fixed fee, an hourly rate, a percentage of benefits recovered, or a combination of such bases.  Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded will be presumed to be reasonable.  Fees which exceed 33 1/3 percent of any past-due benefits awarded will be presumed to be unreasonable.  OGC is responsible for reviewing the reasonableness of fee agreements.</ul>
			<h3>Can this presumption of reasonableness of fees be rebutted?</h3>
				<ul>Yes.  Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded will be presumed to be reasonable.  Fees which exceed 33 1/3 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be unreasonable.  However, these presumptions may be rebutted by establishing that there is clear and convincing evidence that a fee which does not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded is not reasonable, or that a fee which exceeds 33 1/3 percent is reasonable, in a specific circumstance.  OGC may order a reduction in the fee if it finds by clear and convincing evidence, in the case of a fee presumed reasonable, that the fee is unreasonable.   OGC may approve a fee presumed unreasonable if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the fee is reasonable. </ul>
			<h3>If I think that the fee is unreasonable or excessive, can I request VA to take action? </h3>
				<ul>Yes.  If you believe that your agent’s or attorney’s fee is unreasonable or excessive, you may contact OGC at the following address: Office of General Counsel (022D), 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20420.  OGC will review the fee agreement and determine whether the fee is unreasonable or excessive. </ul>
				<ul>Before the expiration of 120 days from the date of the final VA action, OGC may review a fee agreement upon its own motion or upon the motion of a claimant or appellant.  OGC may order a reduction in the fee called for in the agreement if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence (or by clear and convincing evidence in the case of a fee presumed reasonable) that the fee is unreasonable.  OGC may approve a fee presumed unreasonable if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the fee is reasonable.  If an agency of original jurisdiction has made an eligibility determination, then OGC will limit its review and decision to the issue of reasonableness.  OGC’s final decision may be appealed to BVA.</ul>
