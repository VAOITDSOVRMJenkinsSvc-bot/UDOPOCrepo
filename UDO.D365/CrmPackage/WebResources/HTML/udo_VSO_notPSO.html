	<h1> When the calling Veteran Services Officer (VSO) is not the Power of Attorney (POA) of record:</h1>
		<h2>Another POA of Record:</h2>
			<ul>Our records show your organization hasn’t been appointed as the claimant’s representative.  The (name of organization) has the Power of Attorney, and the records are located at the (name of office/facility having the records).  I’m sorry I won’t be able to give you any other information due to the provisions of the Privacy Act.</ul>
		<h2>No POA of Record/Veteran in Office: </h2>
			<ul> Our records show your organization hasn’t been appointed as the veteran’s representative.  If (Mr. XXX / Ms. XXX) is there with you and gives me permission to speak with you, I’ll be able to talk with you about the issues you’re calling about.  (Note:  after properly identifying the claimant, release the requested information to the VSO.)</ul>
