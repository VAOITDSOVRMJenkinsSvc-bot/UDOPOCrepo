	<h1> How Combined Evaluations Are Calculated: </h1>
		<ul> VA does not add individual disability percentages to determine the combined percentage. They use a table from VA regulations in accordance with 38 CFR 4.25 <a href="http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/21/publicat/Regs/Part4/4_25.htm">http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/21/publicat/Regs/Part4/4_25.htm.</a>  This table is based on the "whole person theory."  This means that an individual with no disabilities is 100 percent able.  The table reduces this total ability by the percentage of the veteran’s most disabling or highest rated condition, then by the next, and the next, etc.  </ul>

		<h2> Example: </h2>
			<ul> Let's say the veteran has a 70% disability and a separate 10% disability.  We first consider the 70% disability because it is the highest rated condition.  For VA purposes, the veteran is then considered 30% healthy.  Then we include the 10% disability by calculating 10% of 30%, which is 3% (10% of 30 is 3).  Then add 70 and 3, which is 73% and round down to 70%.</ul>
			<ul> If the veteran’s second disability were 20% instead of 10%, we would add 6% (20% of 30 is 6).  VA would then add 70 and 6, which is 76% and round up to 80%.</ul>
