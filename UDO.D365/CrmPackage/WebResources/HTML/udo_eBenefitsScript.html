        <ul><b><a name="BMwhatisebenefits">1. What is eBenefits?</a></b></ul>
        <ul>The eBenefits portal was developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs to be a web based one-stop shop for online benefits-related tools and information for Wounded Warriors, Veterans, Service Members, their families, and their caretakers.</ul>
        <ul>After you create an account, you can use my eBenefits to set up a profile, add and manage favorite links, access military personnel records such as your DD 214, and view healthcare information, and more.</ul>
        <ul>Explore <a href="https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits-portal/ebenefits.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_nfxr=false&amp;_pageLabel=About">eBenefits</a> to learn more about the available self-service features. Additional capabilities are always in development, so check back often.  To get the most of your eBenefits experience, you will need to obtain a DoD Self Service (DS) Logon.</ul>
        <ul><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></ul>

        <ul><b><a name="BMWhatisaDSLogon">2. What is a DS Logon?</a></b></ul>
        <ul>DS Logon is a secure, self-service logon ID that allows Beneficiaries affiliated with the DoD or the VA access to several websites using a single username and password. If you are already registered in DEERS, you are eligible for a <i>DS Logon</i>. Once you have a <i>DS Logon</i>, it's valid for the rest of your life.</ul>
        <ul>A DS Logon supports the Personnel Identity Protection Directive and National Institute of Standards and Technology e-Authentication guidance. It provides a high level of authentication assurance in situations where Common Access Card authentication is not available.</ul>

        <ul><b><a name="BMWhatisabasiceBenefitsDSLogonAccount">3. What is a Basic (eBenefits) DS Logon Account?</a></b></ul>
        <ul>A Basic DS Logon Basic account is an entry-level user account established online that provides limited access to your personal information. This level of account is only provided to individuals who have registered online on the eBenefits website without being in-person proofed. Many applications within eBenefits will not allow access with a Basic account.</ul>

        <ul><b><a name"BMWhatisaPremiumeBenefitsDSLogonAccount">4. What is a Premium (eBenefits) DS Logon Account?</a></b></ul>
        <ul>A DS Logon Premium account is given to a user who has registered online through an identity proofing process or an in-person proofing process with a VA or DoD agency official. A Premium account is a higher level of validation and assurance as it enables eBenefits users access to personally identifiable information and unlimited access to all eBenefits features.</ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC01">1. Where can Veterans be in-person proofed for an eBenefits Premium (Level 2) account?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  Veterans can be in-person proofed at any regional office or out-based benefit office.  Veterans cannot be in-person proofed at a VA medical clinic.</ul>
        <ul>To be in-person proofed, the Veteran must show two forms of identification.  The types of acceptable identification documents can be found in the DS Access Station User Training guide, which is located at this web address:<a href="http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/27/web_communications/web/ebenefits/training/Docs/DSASTraining.pdf">http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/27/web_communications/web/ebenefits/training/Docs/DSASTraining.pdf</a>.</ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC02">2. Why is ethnicity required on the eBenefits profile?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  This particular information is needed to identify a benefit based on Home Loan Guaranty�s only ethnic-based benefit for Native American Veterans.  The Native American Direct Loan Program provides home loans to eligible Native American Veterans who wish to purchase, construct, or improve a home on Federal trust land.</ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC03">3. If the Veteran changes his address in eBenefits, will this change affect all benefits? </a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  The eBenefits portal will update the C&P Corporate record.  Also, it will update the Post 9/11 GI Bill and C&P electronic payment (Direct Deposit) mailing addresses.  All other VA records, such as VACOLS, medical center systems, loan guaranty, insurance, and Vocational Rehabilitation addresses cannot be updated or changed in eBenefits.  The Veteran must continue to contact the regional office or medical center for all other address changes</ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC04">4. Why the connection of eBenefits and DEERS?</a></b></ul>
        <ul>Answer:  The DS Logon registration process (i.e., issuance of Basic/Premium accounts) is issued by DoD and requires Veterans and Service Members to be registered in DEERS.  The DEERS enrollment is a requirement of DoD in order to grant access to a DS Logon. </ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC05">5. How can a Veteran be added to DEERS?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  The Veteran can visit the regional office/outbased benefit office closest to where they reside and explain the purpose of the visit � to be added to DEERS to obtain an eBenefits account.  The location of the nearest regional office can be obtained here <a href="http://www2.va.gov/directory/guide/home.asp">http://www2.va.gov/directory/guide/home.asp</a>.  Users may enter their zip code to find the nearest regional office/benefit office.</ul>
        <ul>Tell Veteran the regional office will need their complete name, social security number, DD214, proof of address, e.g. utility/phone bill, and date of birth to complete the process.</ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC08">8. Will Veterans be able to submit claims in eBenefits?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  Yes, as the portal provides links to online application services, such as VONAPP.  At this time, it does not accept the online receipt of benefit applications (and transfer those claims automatically).  However, in the future, it may include the ability for Premium account holders to submit online applications for certain types of benefits. </ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC09">9. Can a Veteran�s eBenefits account be deactivated from non-use?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  Yes.  The Defense Manpower Data Center will deactivate a DS Logon credential that has not been used for one year.  When an account is deactivated, the Veteran will have to request a new DS Logon.</ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC10">10. Will eBenefits show the Veteran�s VSO information?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  Currently, the portal does not show the Veteran�s VSO.  In a future release, a Veteran will be able to search for an accredited attorney, claims agent, or VSO using the existing Accreditation Tool and may show the selected VSO in the user�s profile.  Also, the portal may include the ability to request representation from a VSO via execution of an online VA Form 21-22.  </ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC11">11. Can a Veteran get a level 2 using the MyPay login?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  Yes.  If a Veteran has a DFAS myPay Login ID and password, it can be used to receive a Premium (Level 2) DS Logon for eBenefits.  On the eBenefits registration page, Veterans with a myPay Login ID can access the DoD Self-Service Access Center.  After successfully answering challenge questions, the site will generate an activation code, which will be mailed to the Veteran�s current mailing address within 6-12 days.  </ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC12">12. Veterans report a message saying eBenefits is not a secured site. Is eBenefits a secured site? </a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  Yes.  Both eBenefits and DMDC�s registration portals for the DS Logon use secure socket layer hypertext transfer protocols for data encryption.</ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC13">13. When will remote proofing be available to Veterans?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  Remote person proofing is now available.  The remote proofing process is only available to Veterans who are in receipt of an award via direct deposit.  This new process is piloted at the Columbia NCC.  To complete the remote proofing process, the Veteran must validate certain forms of identification, such as the checking or savings account number of the direct deposit, the name of the financial institution or routing number, and the exact payment amount, all of which is in addition to the basic ID protocol requirements.  The Veteran will also be required to provide information on one primary form of identification (e.g., federal or state government ID, passport, Sponsor�s ID card, etc.)</ul>

        <ul><b><a name="CC18">18. Why isn�t the claims status information in eBenefits matching what�s in MAPD?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b> Yes, the claims status information on eBenefits comes directly from MAPD and should match the same information that the portal calls to display to the end user.  The portal does not show all information in MAPD.  For more information on what is displayed in the claim status feature, look at the online eBenefits release guide.  Here�s the address: <a href="http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/27/web_communications/web/ebenefits/training/Docs/eBenefits%202.3%20Release%20guide%20for%20the%20field.pdf">http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/27/web_communications/web/ebenefits/training/Docs/eBenefits%202.3%20Release%20guide%20for%20the%20field.pdf</a></ul>

        <h1>Public Contact Representatives - 12/21/10</h1>
        <ul><b><a name="PCR01">1. Where can Veterans be in-person proofed for an eBenefits Premium (Level 2) account?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b>  Veterans can be in-person proofed at any regional office or outbased benefit office by authorized VA personnel.</ul>
        <ul>DoD recently implemented issuance of the DS Logon (Level 2) to Veterans at 85 TRICARE regional offices throughout the country.  In addition, DoD agreed to accept Veterans who are non-TRICARE patients to complete the required in-person proofing for obtaining a Level 2 DS Logon account.</ul>
        <ul><b>Note:</b> Veterans can only be in-person proofed at a VA medical center or clinic for My HealtheVet access, but not eBenefits.</ul>
        <ul><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></ul>
    
        <ul><b><a name="PCR02">2. Is there an alternate method of in-person proofing for Veterans who cannot visit a regional office or outbased benefit office?</a></b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b> Yes, there are alternative ways in which a Veteran can obtain a Premium (Level 2) account.  These methods include remote person proofing, or if the Veteran is a My HealtheVet account holder, using the Account Request Portal (ARP) to request a DS Logon (Level 2) account.</ul>
        <ul>The remote proofing process is only available to Veterans who are in receipt of an award via direct deposit.  This new process is piloted at the Columbia NCC.  To complete the remote proofing process, the Veteran must validate certain forms of identification, such as the checking or savings account number of the direct deposit, the name of the financial institution or routing number, and the exact payment amount, all of which is in addition to the basic ID protocol requirements.  The Veteran will also be required to provide information on one primary form of identification (e.g., federal or state government ID, passport, Sponsor�s ID card, etc.)</ul>
        <ul>In order to use ARP, the Veteran must have an upgraded (in-person authenticated) My HealtheVet account.  The Veteran can either request a new Premium DS Logon (Level 2) or update an existing Basic (Level 1) account to a new Premium (Level 2) account.  To request or upgrade to a Premium DS Logon (Level 2), the Veteran can go to <a href="http://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-dslogon-portal-web/dslogonauth.portal">http://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-dslogon-portal-web/dslogonauth.portal</a> and sign in with his In-Person Authenticated My HealtheVet credentials and click on the "DS Logon Account Request" tab, and then follow the prompts.  Or, visit the eBenefits Registration page at <a href="https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits-portal/ebenefits.portal?_nfpb=true&_nfxr=false&_pageLabel=RegistrationHelp">https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits-portal/ebenefits.portal?_nfpb=true&_nfxr=false&_pageLabel=RegistrationHelp</a> for guidance on how to use ARP.</ul>
        <ul>In addition to the methods above, a Veteran who is a retiree and has a DFAS myPay Login ID and password can obtain Premium access using his DFAS myPay account.  On the eBenefits registration page, the myPay Login ID can be used to access the DoD Self-Service Access Center.  After successfully answering challenge questions, the site will generate an activation code, which will be mailed to the Veteran�s current mailing address within 6-12 days.</ul>

        <ul><b><a name="PCR04">4. If the Veteran changes his/her address in eBenefits, will the payment, VACOLS, and VA medical center addresses change as well? </b></ul>
        <ul><b>Answer:</b> No.  eBenefits allows the Veteran to change the compensation/pension benefit mailing address or the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit mailing address.  Since eBenefits does not link to VACOLS or the VA medical centers (VAMC), the Veteran must notify the National Call Center and the VAMC for his/her address to be updated.</ul>
