    	<h1>VA MEDICAL CENTER DEBTS</h1>
    		<ul>The Health Resource Center (HRC) can explain to a caller why a debt was established for VAMC issues.  The first proper referral for a caller with a VAMC debt question would be to the Health Resource Center as DMC would not be notified of the debt until after 90 days, possibly up to 120 days.</ul>
		<h2>What Are the Billing Timeframes?</h2>
			<ul>The Veteran is sent three billing statements, 30 days apart, from the VA Medical Center.  After the three statements, the debt is referred to the Debt Management Center.  If no compensation and pension benefit exists to offset, the Veteran is then notified via letter that the debt will be referred to Department of Treasury.  That letter provides them another 30 days to respond.  If Veteran does not respond within that 30 day window, offset will occur within the next 30 days.  So, the debt is initially referred in 90 days, but it may be longer before they are actually offset due to the notification process.</ul>
			<ul>This information is on the back of the billing statement, as well as information on the process to request a waiver or repayment plan for an outstanding debt.</ul>
		<h2>How to Contact Us?</h2>
			<ul>For VAMC Debts Call:	VA Health Resource Center - Phone: 1-877-222-8387</ul>
			<ul>The Health Resource Center now has a Call Center located in Topeka, KS.  It is a VHA sponsored site and not affiliated with VBA.  </ul>
		<h2>What If HRC Cannot Answer a VBA Question?</h2>
			<ul>If HRC cannot answer a VBA related question, a VAI via IRIS will be sent to the IRC for response.</ul>
