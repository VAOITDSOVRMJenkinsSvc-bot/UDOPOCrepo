	<h1>Cost of Living Allowance (COLA)</h1>
	<ul>Under the law, VA may increase benefit amounts by the same percentage that Social Security benefits are increased and no more.  However, with negative inflation and the consumer price index down over the past year, the Social Security Administration has announced that no COLA is payable for 2010.  Therefore, no change will be made to VA compensation and pension rates payable this coming year.</ul>
