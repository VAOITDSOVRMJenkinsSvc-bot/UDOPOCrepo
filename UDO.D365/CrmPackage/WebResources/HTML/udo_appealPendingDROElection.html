	<h1>Appeal Status = Appeal Pending: Decision Review Officer (DRO) Election </h1>
		<ul>I see we received your Notice of Disagreement for <b> (issue(s) on appeal)</b> on <b>(date of NOD)</b>, and you elected a review by a Decision Review Officer on <b>(date of DRO election)</b>. Right now, your appeal is awaiting that review.</ul>
		<ul>If the Decision Review Officer determines we need additional information, we'll notify you to advise what is needed. If we don't need any additional information, the Decision Review Officer will make a decision, and you'll receive written notification. </ul>
		<ul>Unfortunately, we are unable to provide a timeframe as to when your appeal will be reviewed.</ul>
		<ul><b<Note:</b> PCRs should <b><i>not</i></b> advise that the case is "with a DRO" or that the appeal is "currently being worked" when the appeal is actually awaiting a DRO/<i>De Novo</i> review. </ul>
		<ul><b>Reminder:</b> There is <i><b>no</b></i> timeframe for processing or completing appeals.  PCRs should advise their caller that we are unable to provide a timeframe for processing appeals due to the complexity of each appeal.  PCRs are <i><b>not</b></i> to use COVERS to provide appeal status or file location.</ul>
