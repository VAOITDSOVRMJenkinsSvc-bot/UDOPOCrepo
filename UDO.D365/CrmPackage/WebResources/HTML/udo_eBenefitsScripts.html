	<h1>VBA National Call Center Scripts for eBenefits</h1>
		<h2>1.   What is eBenefits?</h2>
		<ul>The <i>eBenefits</i> web portal is an online resource for tools and benefits-related information for wounded warriors, Veterans, active duty service members, their families, and those who care for them.</ul>
		<ul>The President’s Commission on Care for America’s Returning Wounded Warriors (Dole/Shalala) established by Executive Order 13426 in March 2007 recommended the creation of a web portal to provide wounded, ill, and injured service members, Veterans, their family members, and care providers a single and transparent access point to online benefits as well as related content and services.  In response, VA and DoD collaborated on developing the eBenefits Portal where VA has primary responsibility for the project and is designated as the lead agent.</ul>
		<ul class="one">In April 2010, eBenefits launched version 2.3 that allows service members and Veterans to:
			<li>check the status of compensation and pension claims</li>
			<li>view payment history of VA benefits received</li>
			<li>obtain or apply for the home loan certificate of eligibility</li>
			<li>access to MyHealtheVet directly from eBenefits</li>
			<li>access to and retrieval of copies of official military personnel records to include DD-214s and active/reserve orders </li>
		</ul>
		<ul> class="one">Future releases to <i>eBenefits</i> will include the capability to:
			<li>view status of current benefits</li>
			<li>change an address</li>
			<li>change direct deposit information</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>2.     How do I apply for an eBenefits account?</h2>
		<ul>Because eBenefits gives you access to your own personal information in VA, DoD, and eBenefits systems, we must protect your privacy and your confidential information.  Step 1 is confirming your identity prior to creating your account.  After creating your account, there are two levels of access: Level 1 and Level 2.</ul>
		<h2>3.     What is a Level 1 account?  What is a Level 2 account?</h2>
		<ul>A Level 1 account will allow you access to information you researched within eBenefits yourself (such as Favorite Links or categories of benefits you're interested in.) You can also obtain a home loan certificate of eligibility.  Level 1 is a lower form of access than Level 2, but will require less work on your part to obtain.  </ul>
		<ul>A Level 2 account allows you access to your personal information (pending claim information, your VA payment history, etc.) contained in VA’s and DoD’s computer systems.</ul>
		<h2>4.    How do I apply for a Level 1 account?</h2>
		<ul>Go directly to the eBenefits web site at <a href="www.ebenefits.va.gov">www.ebenefits.va.gov.</a>  Fill in the <a href="https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/SiteDown/siteDown.html?_nfpb=true&_nfxr=false&_pageLabel=Registration">eBenefits registration form</a>. A one-time activation code will be displayed and you'll be directed to the DEERS DoD Self-Service Access Center to activate your DoD Self-Service Logon and get a username and password.<br>Return to eBenefits. Click the Login button and use your username and password to log in.</ul>
		<h2>5.    How do I apply for a Level 2 account?</h2>
		<ul>In order to access <i>personal</i> information in <i>eBenefits</i>, all users must have a DoD Self-Service Logon (DS Logon) Level 2 access.  This Level 2 access is <i>required</i> as a security measure to protect sensitive personal information accessible within the system. </ul>
		<ul>In order to obtain Level 2 access and receive a DS Logon, you must undergo an In-Person Proofing (IPP) process.  Proofing is the act of verifying a Veteran’s or beneficiary’s identity.  (See questions 9 and 10 for exceptions to the IPP process.)</ul>
		<ul> class="one">To complete the proofing process, you must apply <b>in person</b> to any of the following VA facilities:
			<li>VA Regional Office</li>
			<li>VA Benefits Office</li>
			<li>VA Medical Center*</li>
			<li>VA Medical Clinic*</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>Note:  *You must be a patient to apply at a VA medical facility.  A patient is defined as someone with an inpatient or outpatient status, or someone enrolled with a Master Patient Index established.  The proofing process will be completed for access to MyHealtheVet which will allow access to <i>eBenefits</i> from the MyHealtheVet portal.  For more information on this process, go to: <a href="http://www.myhealth.va.gov/">http://www.myhealth.va.gov/</a>.</ul>
		<ul> class="one">You will need the following documentation:
			<li>Social Security Number</li>
			<li>Identification card with photograph</li>
			<li>Document with current mailing address (if your address is not currently in the VA data system)</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>Once you have completed the in-person proofing process, you will receive an informational letter in the mail from the DoD Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC).  You should receive this letter approximately 5 to 12 days after your visit to the VA facility.  This letter will contain a web site address (URL) to the <i>eBenefits</i> web portal and a one-time use activation code (PIN) to activate your DS Logon account.  Simply go to the <i>eBenefits</i> website, enter your user name and PIN number, and navigate to your particular area of interest or need.</ul>
		<h2>6.         Is my personal information secure on eBenefits?</h2>
		<ul>Yes.  All sensitive personal information accessible within the system is protected and safeguarded.</ul>
		<h2>7.    Do I have to have a Level 2 credential to access eBenefits?</h2>
		<ul>No.  You may access the <i>eBenefits</i> web portal directly without undergoing the Level 2 credentialing process (considered a Level 1 access).  Level 1 access will only allow you to explore the general information areas of the web portal (e.g., Favorite Links, Home Loan Guaranty information).  It is important to understand that in order to gain access to your personal information you must possess a Level 2 credential.  This requirement is for your protection to ensure the security of your personally sensitive information.</ul>
		<h2>8.    Why can’t I do the credentialing process by telephone?</h2>
		<ul>In order to ensure the maximum protection and security of your personally sensitive information, a strict security protocol must be in place and maintained.  Current security protocol requires an in-person proofing process to ensure the safeguarding of your personal information.</ul>
		<h2>9.        I am currently on active duty.  Do I have to apply in person for Level 2 Access?</h2>
		<ul>No.  Active duty service members may obtain Level 2 access if they register using their Common Access Card (CAC).  Service members holding a CAC card may apply for access directly and do not have to proof in person.</ul>
		<h2>10.  I am a military retiree.  Do I have to apply in person for Level 2 Access?</h2>
		<ul>No.  Retired military personnel may obtain Level 2 access if they register using their Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) PIN.  Retired personnel who have been issued a DFAS PIN may apply for access directly and do <b><i>not</i></b> have to proof in person.</ul>
		<h2>11.  I received my PIN and attempted to access eBenefits, but was unsuccessful.  What do I do?</h2>
		<ul>If you require any assistance activating your account or you have questions regarding the activation instructions, you may contact the Defense Manpower Data Center Support Center (DSC), toll-free at 1-800-477-8227.  The DSC is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including Federal holidays. </ul>
		<h2>12.  I can access my eBenefits account, but am having trouble navigating on the site.  Can anyone help me?</h2>
		<ul>If you require any assistance within the <i>eBenefits</i> web portal, you may contact the <i>eBenefits</i> Customer Support group, toll-free at 1-800-983-0937. A customer support representative will assist you Monday-Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. CST.</ul>
