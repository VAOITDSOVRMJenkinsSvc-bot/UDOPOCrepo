	<h1>When Claimant Isn’t With the Veterans Service Officer:</h1>
		<h2>If the claimant isn’t in the office with the VSO:</h2>
			<ul> I’m sorry, but since (he/she) isn’t there with you, I won’t be able to release information about the claimant.  Privacy Act provisions require me to have (his/her) permission to speak with you.  I know that you’re just trying to help, but I’m sure you understand the reasons why I can’t due to the Privacy Act.  Has your organization sent a completed 21-22 to VA? </ul>
		<h2>If VSO says – yes: </h2>
			<ul>Go to script regarding <a href="VSO_f21-22.html">21-22 submitted</a>, but computer systems haven’t been updated.</ul>
		<h2>If VSO says – no: </h2>
			<ul>We need a completed 21-22, so if (he/she) wants to appoint the (name of organization) as Power of Attorney, please get that to us, and we’ll update our system to reflect that.  Do you need to know where to send the completed form?</ul>

	<h1> When the calling Veteran Services Officer (VSO) is the Power of Attorney (POA) of record: </h1>
		<ul> We show that (name of POA) has the POA for the (name of claimant).  To protect the claimant’s privacy, we must be sure that you are (name of calling VSO) with the (name of service organization) before releasing information.  I hope you understand – so if you could please bear with me while I ask a few questions. </ul>
		<ul> Could I please have the (name of claimant) name, Social Security number/claim number, date of birth, branch of service, and either the date the veteran went on active duty or the date of the veteran’s release from duty.  (There would be pauses between requesting the information and waiting for the responses.) </ul>

	<h2>VSO Has Correct Information: </h2>
			<ul> If the VSO has correct information, release the requested information.</ul>
		<h2>VSO Doesn’t Have the Correct Information: </h2>
			<ul> If the VSO doesn’t have answers to either some of the questions and/or provides incorrect information, please say the following: </ul>
			<ul> I’m sorry, but since we need correct responses to all these questions, I won’t be able to give you the information you’re requesting due to the provisions of the Privacy Act.  If you can get the correct and proper identifying information, please call us back, and we’ll be happy to help you. </ul>

	<h1> When the calling Veteran Services Officer (VSO) is not the Power of Attorney (POA) of record:</h1>
		<h2>Another POA of Record:</h2>
			<ul>Our records show your organization hasn’t been appointed as the claimant’s representative.  The (name of organization) has the Power of Attorney, and the records are located at the (name of office/facility having the records).  I’m sorry I won’t be able to give you any other information due to the provisions of the Privacy Act.</ul>
		<h2>No POA of Record/Veteran in Office: </h2>
			<ul> Our records show your organization hasn’t been appointed as the veteran’s representative.  If (Mr. XXX / Ms. XXX) is there with you and gives me permission to speak with you, I’ll be able to talk with you about the issues you’re calling about.  (Note:  after properly identifying the claimant, release the requested information to the VSO.)</ul>

				<h1>When VA Form 21-22 has been submitted, but computer systems haven’t been updated: </h1>
		<h2>VA Form 21-22 Submitted Less than 14 Days:</h2>
			<ul> I’m sorry, but our computer system doesn’t show (name of organization) has been appointed as the claimant’s representative.  It takes up to 14 days to update our system.  We have two choices:  I can either send an inquiry to the appropriate office to see if your 21-22 has been received.  Or we can wait for a few more days since we’re not quite to the 14-day timeframe to update our system.  What would you like me to do for you?  (After the VSO representative responds, then continue.) </ul>
			<ul> If (Mr. XXX / Ms. XXX) is there with you and gives me permission to speak with you, I’ll be able to talk with you about the issues you’re calling about.  (Note:  after properly identifying the claimant, release the requested information to the VSO.)</ul>
		<h2>VA Form 21-22 Submitted Between 14-30 Days: </h2>
			<ul>I’m sorry, but our computer system doesn’t show  (name of organization) has been appointed as the claimant’s representative.  Let me send an inquiry to the appropriate office to see if your 21-22 has been received.  You should hear from the (name the office) in approximately 5-7 days.</ul>
			<ul>(Note:  Complete VAI through IRIS and send to the office of jurisdiction.  Ask them to update POA - VA Form 21-22 sent to their office approximately (insert date sent).  Ask that office to call the VSO if the 21-22 was found and entered into our system.  If no 21-22 found, that office should request the VSO to please resubmit.)</ul>
			<ul>If (Mr. XXX / Ms. XXX) is there with you and gives me permission to speak with you, I’ll be able to talk with you about the issues you’re calling about.  (Note:  after properly identifying the claimant, release the requested information to the VSO.)</ul>
		<h2>VA Form 21-22 Submitted More Than 30 days or Submitted More Than Once: </h2>
			<ul>I’m so sorry, but our computer system still hasn’t been updated to show that your organization has Power of Attorney as the claimant’s representative. If you have a copy and can fax it to me, I’ll be sure to get that copy to the appropriate office for immediate update and ask that as soon as the update is processed to call you.  So please put the telephone number on the fax where you want the call back.  Here’s my fax number: XXX-XXX-XXXX.</ul>
			<ul>If (Mr. XXX / Ms. XXX) is there with you and gives me permission to speak with you, I’ll be able to talk with you about the issues you’re calling about.  (Note:  after properly identifying the claimant, release the requested information to the VSO.)</ul>
			<ul>(After receiving the fax, immediately send it to the appropriate office’s Public Contact Team (get fax numbers from the Desk References, PCR Index) to include a cover sheet that must include:  your name, telephone number, and Contact Center, as well as the name, organization, and call back number of the VSO.  The cover sheet should state that as soon as the 21-22 has been entered, that the VSO should be called on: XXX-XXX-XXXX.) </ul>
