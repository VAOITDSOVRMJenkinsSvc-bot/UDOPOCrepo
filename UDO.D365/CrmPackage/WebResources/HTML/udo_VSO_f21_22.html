	<h1>When VA Form 21-22 has been submitted, but computer systems haven’t been updated: </h1>
		<h2>VA Form 21-22 Submitted Less than 14 Days:</h2>
			<ul> I’m sorry, but our computer system doesn’t show (name of organization) has been appointed as the claimant’s representative.  It takes up to 14 days to update our system.  We have two choices:  I can either send an inquiry to the appropriate office to see if your 21-22 has been received.  Or we can wait for a few more days since we’re not quite to the 14-day timeframe to update our system.  What would you like me to do for you?  (After the VSO representative responds, then continue.) </ul>
			<ul> If (Mr. XXX / Ms. XXX) is there with you and gives me permission to speak with you, I’ll be able to talk with you about the issues you’re calling about.  (Note:  after properly identifying the claimant, release the requested information to the VSO.)</ul>
		<h2>VA Form 21-22 Submitted Between 14-30 Days: </h2>
			<ul>I’m sorry, but our computer system doesn’t show  (name of organization) has been appointed as the claimant’s representative.  Let me send an inquiry to the appropriate office to see if your 21-22 has been received.  You should hear from the (name the office) in approximately 5-7 days.</ul>
			<ul>(Note:  Complete VAI through IRIS and send to the office of jurisdiction.  Ask them to update POA - VA Form 21-22 sent to their office approximately (insert date sent).  Ask that office to call the VSO if the 21-22 was found and entered into our system.  If no 21-22 found, that office should request the VSO to please resubmit.)</ul>
			<ul>If (Mr. XXX / Ms. XXX) is there with you and gives me permission to speak with you, I’ll be able to talk with you about the issues you’re calling about.  (Note:  after properly identifying the claimant, release the requested information to the VSO.)</ul>
		<h2>VA Form 21-22 Submitted More Than 30 days or Submitted More Than Once: </h2>
			<ul>I’m so sorry, but our computer system still hasn’t been updated to show that your organization has Power of Attorney as the claimant’s representative. If you have a copy and can fax it to me, I’ll be sure to get that copy to the appropriate office for immediate update and ask that as soon as the update is processed to call you.  So please put the telephone number on the fax where you want the call back.  Here’s my fax number: XXX-XXX-XXXX.</ul>
			<ul>If (Mr. XXX / Ms. XXX) is there with you and gives me permission to speak with you, I’ll be able to talk with you about the issues you’re calling about.  (Note:  after properly identifying the claimant, release the requested information to the VSO.)</ul>
			<ul>(After receiving the fax, immediately send it to the appropriate office’s Public Contact Team (get fax numbers from the Desk References, PCR Index) to include a cover sheet that must include:  your name, telephone number, and Contact Center, as well as the name, organization, and call back number of the VSO.  The cover sheet should state that as soon as the 21-22 has been entered, that the VSO should be called on: XXX-XXX-XXXX.) </ul>
