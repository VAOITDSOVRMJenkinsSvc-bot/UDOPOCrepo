	<h1>When Claimant Isn’t With the Veterans Service Officer:</h1>
		<h2>If the claimant isn’t in the office with the VSO:</h2>
			<ul> I’m sorry, but since (he/she) isn’t there with you, I won’t be able to release information about the claimant.  Privacy Act provisions require me to have (his/her) permission to speak with you.  I know that you’re just trying to help, but I’m sure you understand the reasons why I can’t due to the Privacy Act.  Has your organization sent a completed 21-22 to VA? </ul>
		<h2>If VSO says – yes: </h2>
			<ul>Go to script regarding <a href="VSO_f21-22.html">21-22 submitted</a>, but computer systems haven’t been updated.</ul>
		<h2>If VSO says – no: </h2>
			<ul>We need a completed 21-22, so if (he/she) wants to appoint the (name of organization) as Power of Attorney, please get that to us, and we’ll update our system to reflect that.  Do you need to know where to send the completed form?</ul>
