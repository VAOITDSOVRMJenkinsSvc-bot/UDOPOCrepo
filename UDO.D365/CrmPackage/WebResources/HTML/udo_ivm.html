    	<h1>Income Verification Match (IVM) Scripts</h1>
		<h2>1.  Caller needs general information regarding IVMs.</h2>
			<ul>VA routinely matches income information with other agencies.  When the information provided does not match the amounts we used, we issue a series of letters for clarification.  We at the call center are not permitted to view this information or any letters associated with this match.</ul>
		<h2>2.  Claimant needs assistance understanding the IVM letter</h2>
			<ul>Due to security reasons I am not able to see a copy of your letter. In order to assist you, please read the first part of the letter so I can better assist you.  </ul>
			<ul><b>Note:</b>The back of the letter indicates the source and amount of income reported.</ul>
		<h2>3.  Claimant disputes the income reported via the IVM.  </h2>
			<ul>To properly document your dispute of this information, please provide a statement in writing regarding your position on a separate piece of paper or by using the VA Form  21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, which was sent to you.  In addition, please submit any supporting documentation from the source of the income which verifies that this was not your income.  Please make sure you sign your statement and that your VA file number is on everything you send.</ul>
			<ul><i>Advise the claimant to send this information to the address at the top of the letter or determine the correct PMC based on jurisdiction.</i></ul>
		<h2>4.  Claimant says he or she accepted income for someone else (income received from gambling):</h2>
			<ul>Unfortunately, because you signed paperwork which certified that this income was in fact yours, we must consider it when determining your rate of VA pension.  However, if you had any gambling losses, you may claim them to offset the income in question. To properly document the dispute of this information, please provide a statement in writing regarding your position on a separate piece of paper or the VA Form  21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, which was sent to you.  You may want to check with the casino to see how they can help you verify your losses.  Please make sure you sign your statement and that your VA file number is on everything you send.</ul>
		<h2>5.  Claimant wants to know if we received his/her response to the letter.</h2>
			<ul>Unfortunately, due to the sensitive nature of the information, I am unable to verify if we have received your response by our computer systems.  Once the information is received, one of the members of the claims processing team will review your response and any other pertinent information before making a determination.  We will contact you by letter if we need anything else.  If you would like to send additional information, please send it to (<i>provide address for PMC of jurisdiction</i>).</ul>
		<h2>6.  The claimant says he or she was a victim of identity theft.</h2>
			<ul>I am sorry to hear this.  In order to clear this issue we will need some additional documentation.  Please send us a letter from the Social Security Administration (SSA) showing the date you reported to SSA that your Social Security number was fraudulently used, and the actions that SSA has taken to resolve this issue.  If you were issued a new Social Security number, please submit documentation showing this and the reason for the new number.  If you are unable to obtain this information from SSA, you may also submit a police report showing the date that you reported this identity theft.</ul>
			<ul><i>Advise the claimant to send this information to the address at the top of the letter or determine the correct PMC based on jurisdiction.</i></ul>
		<h2>7.  VSO calls regarding IVM and most recent version of VA Form 21-22 was not executed within the past 5 years.</h2>
			<ul>Due to additional security restrictions put in place to protect the claimant's personal information, we do not routinely release these letters and cannot speak to service organizations unless an appointment was executed within the past 5 years on the most recent version of VA Form 21-22.  However, I will be happy to attempt to provide you with general information regarding this issue.</ul>
			<ul>If the VSO alleges the most recent version of VA Form 21-22 was signed within the past 5 years but Virtual VA doesn't show this information, advise:</ul>
			<ul>Unfortunately, I am unable to confirm that the current version of VA Form 21-22 was signed and I am not authorized to discuss specific information regarding the income verification match with you.</ul>
