    	<h1>Appeal-Open</h1>
		<h2>Appeal Status = Appeal-Open</h2>
			<ul>I see we received your notice of disagreement for <b>(issue(s) on appeal)</b> on <b>(date of NOD)</b>.  It's still in the initial stages of processing.  We'll be reviewing your appeal to determine if additional information is needed.  If so, we will inform you of what is needed by letter.</ul>
		<h1>Appeal Pending: Decision Review Officer (DRO) Election</h1>
		<h2>Appeal Status = Appeal Pending: Decision Review Officer (DRO) Election</h2>
			<ul>I see we received your Notice of Disagreement for <b> (issue(s) on appeal)</b> on <b>(date of NOD)</b>, and you elected a review by a Decision Review Officer on <b>(date of DRO election)</b>. Right now, your appeal is awaiting that review.</ul>
			<ul>If the Decision Review Officer determines we need additional information, we'll notify you to advise what is needed. If we don't need any additional information, the Decision Review Officer will make a decision, and you'll receive written notification. </ul>
			<ul>Unfortunately, we are unable to provide a timeframe as to when your appeal will be reviewed.</ul>
			<ul><b<Note:</b> PCRs should <b><i>not</i></b> advise that the case is "with a DRO" or that the appeal is "currently being worked" when the appeal is actually awaiting a DRO/<i>De Novo</i> review. </ul>
			<ul><b>Reminder:</b> There is <i><b>no</b></i> timeframe for processing or completing appeals.  PCRs should advise their caller that we are unable to provide a timeframe for processing appeals due to the complexity of each appeal.  PCRs are <i><b>not</b></i> to use COVERS to provide appeal status or file location.</ul>
		<h1>Appeal Pending: Traditional Review Election </h1>
		<h2>Appeal Status = Appeal Pending: Traditional Review Election</h2>
			<ul>We received your Notice of Disagreement for (issue(s) on appeal) on (date of NOD). It's still in the initial stages of processing. Your appeal will be reviewed under the traditional appeal process. Right now, your appeal is awaiting that review. If we need additional information, we will contact you.</ul>
			<ul>(Optional) We are unable to provide a timeframe as to when your appeal will be reviewed because the appeals process can be lengthy.</ul>
			<ul>Reminder: There is no timeframe for processing or completing appeals. PCRs should advise their caller that we are unable to provide a timeframe for processing appeals due to the complexity of each appeal.</ul>
