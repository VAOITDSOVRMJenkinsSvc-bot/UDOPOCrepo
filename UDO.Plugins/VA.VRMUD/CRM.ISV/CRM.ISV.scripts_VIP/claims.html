    	<h1>Apology (generic) Due to Complaints on How Long It's Taking to Process Claim During "any" Stage</h1>
    		<ul>I'm sorry. I can understand why you may be frustrated. We are currently processing a large volume of claims and we are doing our best to process these as quickly as possible. We generally process claims in the order received.</ul>
			<ul>Note: If caller indicates a hardship exists, PCR should advise the caller to send/FAX documentation of the hardship (eviction/foreclosure notice; past due utility bill, etc). See Financial Hardship Claimed or Terminal Illness Hardship Claimed script.</ul>
    	<h1>Reopened Claim / Original Claim</h1>
		<h2>Reopened claim:</h2>
			<ul>It appears you want to file a (reopened/increased/new) claim for your (condition(s) specified). I will document our phone call, and this will start the claims process. You'll receive a letter or telephone call in the near future telling you what you need to do and what we're doing.</ul>
		<h2>Original claim:</h2>
			<ul>It appears you want to file an original claim for compensation (ask caller for specific disabilities), pension (give eligibility criteria; i.e., wartime service, income/net worth and dependency), DIC, or death pension. So I will document our phone call.</ul>
			<ul>In order to protect the date we can pay you if your claim is approved, you need to send us a completed application for benefits within one year from today. The application you need to complete is VA Form 21- (526 or 534). You have one year from today to file your claim. This means if benefits are granted, you'll be paid from the date of this phone call. If we don't receive your claim within the year, we can pay you only from the date we receive it.</ul>
			<ul>There are several ways to get and complete this application. You can complete the application on line, or download the application from the Internet and mail it to us. Or I can send you an application in the mail. Which do you prefer?</ul>
		<h2>If Internet:</h2>
			<ul>Completing application online: VONAPP: you can go to <a href="http://www.va.gov/">www.va.gov</a>. At the top of Internet page, look for "apply online" and it will walk you through the steps.</ul>
			<ul>Download application: you can go to <a href="http://www.va.gov/">www.va.gov</a> and look for VA Form 21-(526 or 534) <b>(Provide ROJ address to return completed form.)</b></ul>
		<h2>If U.S. mail:</h2>
			<ul>Please give me your address. <b>(Provide ROJ address to return completed form.)</b>	</ul>
