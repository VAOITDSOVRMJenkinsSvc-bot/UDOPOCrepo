	<h1>Abusive Caller </h1>
		<h2><i>We don't expect PCRs to listen to cursing either. However, we have an obligation to let the caller know the following before we disconnect the call:</i></h2>
		<ul>My managers don't permit me to listen to cursing.<br>I want to help you.<br>I'm asking that you please stop cursing.<br>If you don't stop, then I will need to disconnect the call.</ul>
		<h2><i>If the caller continues to curse, then the PCR should:</i></h2>
		<ul>Tell the caller that because he/she didn't stop cursing as requested that the call will be disconnected.</ul>
		<ul>Ask the caller to please call back when he/she is in a position to discuss the situation more calmly.</ul>
		<ul>Say good-bye, and hang up -- in a professional and appropriate tone.<br>E-mail or prepare a 27-0820 to the supervisor briefly outlining the situation, giving the caller's name if at all possible. If the caller telephones and asks to speak to the supervisor, then the supervisor is better able to discuss the situation with the caller.</ul>
