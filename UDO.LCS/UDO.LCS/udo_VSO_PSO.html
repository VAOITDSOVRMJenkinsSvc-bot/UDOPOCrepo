	<h1> When the calling Veteran Services Officer (VSO) is the Power of Attorney (POA) of record: </h1>
		<ul> We show that (name of POA) has the POA for the (name of claimant).  To protect the claimant’s privacy, we must be sure that you are (name of calling VSO) with the (name of service organization) before releasing information.  I hope you understand – so if you could please bear with me while I ask a few questions. </ul>
		<ul> Could I please have the (name of claimant) name, Social Security number/claim number, date of birth, branch of service, and either the date the veteran went on active duty or the date of the veteran’s release from duty.  (There would be pauses between requesting the information and waiting for the responses.) </ul>

		<h2>VSO Has Correct Information: </h2>
			<ul> If the VSO has correct information, release the requested information.</ul>
		<h2>VSO Doesn’t Have the Correct Information: </h2>
			<ul> If the VSO doesn’t have answers to either some of the questions and/or provides incorrect information, please say the following: </ul>
			<ul> I’m sorry, but since we need correct responses to all these questions, I won’t be able to give you the information you’re requesting due to the provisions of the Privacy Act.  If you can get the correct and proper identifying information, please call us back, and we’ll be happy to help you. </ul>
